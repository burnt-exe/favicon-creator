## 1. Introduction

Favicon Creator is a user-friendly application designed to help you easily convert your images into favicon (.ico) format. Whether you're a web developer, designer, or just someone who wants to personalize their website, Favicon Creator simplifies the process of creating professional-looking favicons.

2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to your desired location.
3. Double-click on the `favicon_creator` executable to launch the application.

## 4. Using Favicon Creator

### 4.1 Selecting Images

1. Click the "Browse Images" button.
2. In the file dialog that appears, navigate to the folder containing your images.
3. Select one or more images you want to convert. Favicon Creator supports PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, and BMP formats.
4. Click "Open" to confirm your selection.

The paths of your selected images will appear in the application window.

### 4.2 Choosing Save Location

1. Click the "Select Save Location" button.
2. In the folder dialog that appears, navigate to where you want to save your favicons.
3. Click "Select Folder" to confirm your choice.

The chosen save location will be displayed in the application window.

3. Once complete, a success message will appear.

Your favicons will be saved in the chosen location with the same names as the original files, but with the .ico extension.

### 4.4 Adjusting Image Settings

Favicon Creator automatically optimizes your images for favicon use. However, you can adjust some settings:

- **Resize**: Use the resize slider to adjust the size of your favicon. The recommended size is 16x16 pixels, but you can go up to 256x256 pixels.
- **Transparency**: If your original image has a transparent background, you can choose to preserve it by checking the "Keep Transparency" box.

## 5. Tips for Creating Great Favicons

1. **Keep it Simple**: Favicons are small, so simple designs work best.
2. **Use Bold Colors**: Strong, contrasting colors make your favicon stand out.
3. **Test at Small Sizes**: Your favicon should be recognizable even at 16x16 pixels.
4. **Use Transparent Backgrounds**: This allows your favicon to look good on different colored browser tabs.
5. **Maintain Consistency**: Your favicon should align with your website's branding.

## 6. Troubleshooting

**Issue**: The application won't start.
**Solution**: Ensure you have extracted all files from the ZIP archive. If the issue persists, try running the application as an administrator.

**Issue**: The conversion process fails.
**Solution**: Check that your input images are not corrupted and are in a supported format (PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, BMP).

**Issue**: The favicon doesn't appear on my website.
**Solution**: Make sure you've uploaded the favicon to your server and properly linked it in your HTML. The typical code is:
```html
<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/path/to/favicon.ico">
```
